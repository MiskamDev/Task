# The high-rise building has 5 entrances with 20 apartments each
# everyone. There are 4 apartments on each floor.
# The apartments are numbered in a row, from bottom to top: 
# on the 1st floor, 1st entrance are 
# apartments 5, 6, 8 and so on. 
# Write a script that gets the number 
# apartments and displays the entrance number on the screen
# and floors.
# Test the script on different input values.
